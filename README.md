# Disaster-Response-ML-Model
This project is part of the Data Scientist Nanodegree Program by Udacity. The project analyses disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages, as well as a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories.
